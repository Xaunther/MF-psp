# MF-psp

My first code for PSP. Following the tutorial from [psp-dev](https://psp-dev.org/doku.php?id=tutorial:hello_world)

## Summary

Makes a Hello World project. Displays Hello World message in psp debug screen. Trying to exit crashes the console :D.

## Compilation (Linux)

Browse to the build folder and run `make` from there. You'll need to have installed the latest release of [pspdev](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev). You need to add `<pspdevfolder>/bin` to your PATH variable.
**I hope to learn many things!**
